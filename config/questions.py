## SOME ANNOYING QUESTIONS BY COMPANIES 🫠 ##

# What to enter in your desired salary question (American and European), What is your expected CTC (South Asian and others)?, only enter in numbers as some companies only allow numbers,
desired_salary = 27000          # 80000, 90000, 100000 or 120000 and so on... Do NOT use quotes
'''
Note: If question has the word "lakhs" in it (Example: What is your expected CTC in lakhs), 
then it will add '.' before last 5 digits and answer. Examples: 
* 2400000 will be answered as "24.00"
* 850000 will be answered as "8.50"
And if asked in months, then it will divide by 12 and answer. Examples:
* 2400000 will be answered as "200000"
* 850000 will be answered as "70833"
'''

# What is your current CTC? Some companies make it compulsory to be answered in numbers...
current_ctc = 0            # 800000, 900000, 1000000 or 1200000 and so on... Do NOT use quotes
'''

# Currency of salaries you mentioned. Companies that allow string inputs will add this tag to the end of numbers. Eg: 
currency = "GBP"                 # "USD", "INR", "EUR", "GBP", etc.

# What is your notice period in days?
notice_period = 0                   # Any number >= 0 without quotes. Eg: 0, 7, 15, 30, 45, etc.
'''
Note: If question has 'month' or 'week' in it (Example: What is your notice period in months), 
then it will divide by 30 or 7 and answer respectively. Examples:
* For notice_period = 66:
  - "66" OR "2" if asked in months OR "9" if asked in weeks
* For notice_period = 15:"
  - "15" OR "0" if asked in months OR "2" if asked in weeks

# Your LinkedIn headline in quotes Eg: "Software Engineer @ Google, Masters in Computer Science", "Recent Grad Student @ MIT, Computer Science"
linkedin_headline = "MENG Electrical and Electronic Engineering Graduate | Embedded Systems | Full-Stack Development" # "Headline" or "" to leave this question unanswered

# Your summary in quotes, use \n to add line breaks if using single quotes "Summary".You can skip \n if using triple quotes """Summary"""

# Your cover letter in quotes, use \n to add line breaks if using single quotes "Cover Letter".You can skip \n if using triple quotes """Cover Letter""" (This question makes sense though)
cover_letter = """Dear Hiring Manager,

I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering graduate from the University of Sheffield, passionate about building products that seamlessly connect hardware, software, and user experience. I see myself at the intersection of product thinking and hands-on engineering—where curiosity drives innovation and precision turns ideas into reality.

Recently, I led the end-to-end development of a full-stack EV rental and tracking platform, integrating an AT6668 GPS module with an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi to collect live telemetry data, which I structured into JSON and transmitted via HTTP to a PHP REST API and MariaDB backend. On the front end, I built a real-time web interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Leaflet.js for live maps, trip playback, and booking management. This project strengthened my ability to define clear problems, balance trade-offs, and deliver measurable impact—skills that translate directly into product and engineering collaboration.

Security and reliability are also central to how I approach technology. I independently developed a modular B2B e-commerce platform (React + TypeScript + PHP REST API + MySQL) with an accessible UI and a secure backend employing prepared statements, TOTP-based 2FA. On the embedded side, I designed a microcontroller-based password lock (Mbed OS, KiCad, sLCD), implementing progressive lockouts and robust admin controls to enhance system integrity. My research on hardware Trojans in Approximate Computing using MATLAB deepened my understanding of risk analysis and system dependability.

I bring to a team a bridge between technical depth and product clarity—translating complex systems into actionable priorities and working effectively with both engineers and designers to deliver user-focused outcomes. I am eager to contribute this combination of analytical rigor, creativity, and execution to a forward-thinking engineering team.

Kind regards,

Gianni Zhang

Hi, I'm Gianni Zhang, a recent MEng graduate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Sheffield. I am passionate about building products that merge hands-on engineering with product-focused thinking, and I have practical project experience in both full-stack development and embedded systems.

I independently designed and delivered a B2B fashion e-commerce platform using React, TypeScript, and a PHP REST API, implementing security features like TOTP 2FA. I also led the end-to-end development of a full-stack IoT EV rental and tracking platform, integrating an Arduino and GPS module with a PHP backend and a live web interface. My other projects include designing an Mbed OS-based microcontroller password lock and researching hardware Trojans in Approximate Computing using MATLAB.

I am proficient in technologies like Python, C, PHP, MATLAB, and KiCad, and I am bilingual in Mandarin (Native) and English (IELTS 6.5). I am seeking a role where I can apply my cross-disciplinary technical skills and product-oriented mindset.
